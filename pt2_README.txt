For this section, I had to implement the masterServer. I first had to fix an error in my BasicServer, where I allowed SharedClients to enter when a BasicClient was inside of the server. 

For the MasterServer, I implemented a lock, and two hashmaps containing conditions of the lock. The hashmap is so that each basic server within the masterserver has its own locks so that when a client connects or disconnects successfully, only clients within that respective server is notified. The conditions are for two states, where a thread is not front of the queue, than it waits. The other condition is for threads at the front of the queue. After a successful connect, the client is removed from the queue and only the notFirstInQueue is signalled because if the next client can enter the server, it will not wait for the firstInQueue condition, and if it does wait, it will run after the current clients in the server disconnects.
